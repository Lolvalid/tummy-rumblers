# tummy-rumblers
Small project attempting to make a simple ordering app.

v.001 - Initial commit
  - added basic text file reading for restraunt list
  - added basic text file reading for menu list

Things to add: 
  - cart
  - tip option
  - exporting order to a text file (presume to then send to fake buisness)

Challenges:
  - keep formatted
  - idk like actually comment my code better this time.
